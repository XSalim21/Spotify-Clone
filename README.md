# Spotify-Clone
This is  Full Stack Spotify Clone built with Next 13.4, React, Tailwind, Supabase, PostgreSQL, and Stripe, i've learnt develop a complete music streaming application from scratch, replicating the popular features and functionalities of Spotify.

Using the power of Next.js 13.4 and React, i've created a responsive and dynamic user interface that closely resembles Spotify's sleek design. Harnessing the flexibility of Tailwind CSS, i've also styled this application with ease and achieve a visually stunning result.

To handle the backend, i've  utilize Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative built on top of PostgreSQL. I've learnthow to set up your Supabase project, create database schemas, and implement authentication, ensuring secure user registration and login processes.

Additionally, i've  integrate Stripe, a leading payment processing platform, to enable premium subscriptions within my Spotify clone. Discover how to handle transactions, securely manage user billing information, and provide a seamless payment experience.
